# Tvastra

This is a static website for my project named Tvastra which is just a demo website for hospitals. Current project demonstrated here is just the static part of the entire full stack project with authentication and other functionalities which will be hosted in other repository.

This is fully responsive website created with pure HTML and CSS using Scss as a CSS framework with major breakpoints added. Some misalignments could be corrected in next version.

Jquery is used for carousel part only.
